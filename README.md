# The Book List

A personalized book website! Instead of adding all of the details of books in HTML, the data is added on the page from the `books` array in `index.js` using JavaScript.

## Book Details

The book details are displayed on the page, such as author's name, book title and reading status. The book cover appears above the book details and the image goes to the link to the URL of the book cover.

## Status

The styling of reading status is been updated depending on whether the book has been read - the bootstrap badge style changes as well as the text, which should appear as "Read".

## Order

The authors' last names appears first e.g. "Smith, John". Furthermore, the books are been displayed on the page in alphabetical order according to the authors' last names.
